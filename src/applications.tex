\chapter{Visualization Applications}
\label{ch:visapp}

\begin{itemize}
\item Different kinds of application requirements
\item Exploratory for single dataset (information gathering)
\item Repeating processes on multiple datasets
\item Public dissemination
\item Evaluations
\begin{itemize}
    \item Many papers in InfoVis have been written about evaluations
    \item How are they applicable to scivis or vis in general
\end{itemize}
\item Interplay between Visualization and applications from a scientific (= domain expert) point of view
\item "introduces the concepts that i have used in my work"
\item Telling a story that leads up to contribution 
\item Shortest path for a new person to understand the contributions

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item ''Supported claims, needs more academic tone''
\item ''Generic, explain the methodolgy''
\item ''Participatory design''
\item Different kinds of application requirements
\item Exploratory for single dataset (information gathering)
\item Repeating processes on multiple datasets
\item Public dissemination / Robustness
\item Evaluations \cite{plaisant2004challenge} (how to report evaluations: \cite{forsell2012guide})
\item ''This is what people think about collaboration and I did that''
\item Telling a story that leads up to contribution 
\item Shortest path for a new person to understand the contributions

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Initial information gathering
\item Applying the same techniques to more datasets
\item Learning about the terminology that experts use
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tamara Munzner's nested design is similar to software engineering waterflow model
\item Make comparisons to Scrum + sprits
\item Combining multiple applications to deal with a problem \cite{rungta2013manyvis}

\end{itemize}
