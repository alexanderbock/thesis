\begin{itemize}
\item ''Supported claims, needs more academic tone''
\item ''Generic, explain the methodolgy''
\item ''Participatory design''
\item Different kinds of application requirements
\item Exploratory for single dataset (information gathering)
\item Repeating processes on multiple datasets

\item Evaluations
\item ''This is what people think about collaboration and I did that''
\item Telling a story that leads up to contribution
