One of the best things about my experiences of the Swedish academic environment is its internationality.  It will always remain strong in my mind.

My first and foremost thanks go to my two supervisors, Timo Ropinski and Anders Ynnerman, without none of this would have ever happened.  Timo, who would have thought that me applying for a student technician job would ultimately lead to a Diploma thesis, a chance in country, and a PhD thesis in Norrk\"oping.  I will be ever grateful for the help and the opportunity; I have never looked back and regretted that 24\,h decision to move northwards.  Prof.~Ynnerman, thank you for revitalizing my love everything space-related and providing me with the opportunity to work on these topics.  Anders, tack f\"or att du har introducerat mig f\"or alla intressanta m\"anniskor vid v\aa ra visningar tillsammans.  Jag \"ar skyldig dig en drink\footnote{Thanks for all of the interesting people that I met through our shows; I owe you a drink.}!

Thanks to Ingrid for helping out with many difficult questions and providing a new viewpoint on the value of applications.

To Eva Sk\"arblom and Gun-Britt who helped out in so many different ways that would require their own dedication page.  Tack s\aa mycket!

Thanks to Carter who, in many ways, is the polar opposite of me;  to Masha, thank you for taking me in and for the trust throughout the years of collaboration;  to Cl\'audio, for opening up the opportunity for a new exciting life phase.

A collective thanks to everyone at the Visualization Center C in Norrk\"oping.  It is a priviledge to work in a place to which other people travel for their vacations.

\question{Which funding agencies and funding numbers should I put in here?}

Vielen Dank an meine Familie f\"ur die lebenslange Unterst\"utzung\footnote{Thanks also to my family for the lifetime support}!

To my incredibly understanding wife Mina.  Meeting and marrying someone during the second half of a PhD must be the worst possible timing and, yet, she did not run away.  I do not have more to say than \<`A^sqtm>
