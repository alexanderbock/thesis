One of the best things about the Swedish academic environment is its internationality. Not having been exposed to this before starting, it will always remain strong in my mind.

My first and foremost thanks have to go to my two supervisors, Timo Ropinski and Anders Ynnerman, without none of this would have ever happened. Timo, who would have thought that me applying to a student technician job would ultimately lead to a Diploma thesis, leading to a chance in country, leading to a PhD thesis in Norrk\"oping. I will be ever grateful for the help and the opportunity; I have never looked back and regretted that 24\,h decision to move northwards. Prof.~Ynnerman, thank you for revitalizing my love everything space related and providing the opportunity for me to work on these topics. Anders, tack f\"or att du har introducerat mig f\"or alla intressanta m\"anniskor vid v\aa ra visningar tillsammans. Jag \"ar skyldig dig en drink\footnote{for all of the interesting people that I met through our shows; I owe you a drink.}!

Big thanks to Carter who in many ways is the extact opposite of me, which makes the combination unstoppable; to Masha, thank you for taking me in and for the trust throughout the years of collaboration; to Cl\'audio, for opening up the opportunity for a new exciting life phase.

Vielen Dank auch an meine Familie f\"ur die lebenslange Unterst\"utzung\footnote{Thanks also to my family for the lifetime support}!

And last, but definitely not least, to my incredibly understanding wife Mina. Meeting and marrying someone in the second half of a PhD must be the worst possible time and, yet, she did not run away. I do not have more to say than this: \<`A^sqtm>
