\begin{itemize}
\item Visualization
\item Applications
\item Interplay between Visualization and applications from a scientific (= domain expert) point of view
\item "introduces the concepts that i have used in my work"

\end{itemize}

\section{Visualization}
\begin{itemize}
\item It's all the same (solving the same problem with different tools)
\item SciVis
\item InfoVis
\item VAST
\item Background to the contributions regarding scivis/vis/..
\item ''\{Don't write a textbook\}''
\item Telling a story that leads up to contribution 
\item Shortest path for a new person to understand the contributions
\item Performance is important even if GPUs are getting faster since the simulation people's computer are getting faster, too
\item combination of automated systems and the human-in-the-loop \cite{munzner2014visualization} \cite{van2005value} -> Shows importance of domain expert integration
\end{itemize}
