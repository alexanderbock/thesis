\chapter{Iterative Appliation Design (contributions)}
\label{ch:contributions}

This chapter describes the contributions of all papers that are included in the thesis and them to the descriptions about application design as described in the previous chapter. The following sections first describe the separation of papers into topic areas and then elaborate on each of the topics.

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}
Due to the varied nature of application papers, this papers are separated into three topic areas:

\textbf{Biological and Medical Visualization. } \paperef{paperA} and \paperef{paperB} deal with algorithmic and application design challenges regarding biological simulation and medical intervention support respectively~(\SC{sec:medbio}).

\textbf{Urban Search \& Rescue. } \paperef{paperC}, \paperef{paperD}, and \paperef{paperE} describe the collaborative work on designing a visualization system to support urban search \& rescue operators and rescuers~(\SC{sec:usar}).

\textbf{Astrophysical Phenomena. } The papers in this topic deal with visualization system that were performed to deal with astronomical and astrophysical phenomena. \paperef{paperF} and \paperef{paperH} describe visualization system that are applied to space weather and ion simulations respectively, where as \paperef{paperG} describes the required algorithm necessary to achieve these systems.

Each of the topics provides a short introduction into the domain and, then, elaborate on the work that has been done in the respective papers.
